                    <p>
                        I am Dhiraj Patel, a data enthusiast with a Bachelor of Engineering from Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering, graduating with a CGPA of 9.28/10. With over four years of experience in the analytics domain, I've honed my skills and expertise to deliver impactful solutions that drive business growth and efficiency.

                    <p>
                        In my most recent role as a Senior Data Scientist at Think360.AI, I've led projects that have made significant contributions to client success. For instance, I spearheaded the development of predictive models for a large-scale Indian bank, resulting in substantial savings and enhanced decision-making capabilities. Additionally, I've collaborated with cross-functional teams to streamline processes and deliver top-quality solutions that meet and exceed client expectations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prior to this, I worked as a Data Scientist at Think360.AI, where I gained valuable experience in leveraging data and analytics to uncover insights and drive strategic decision-making. I've also had the opportunity to contribute to various projects, such as developing real-time fraud detection systems and automating data collection processes, which have had a positive impact on business operations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of my professional endeavors, I am deeply committed to continuous learning and growth. I actively engage in academic and co-curricular projects to expand my knowledge and skillset, and I'm always seeking out new challenges and opportunities to further develop my expertise in the analytics field.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Driven by a passion for data and a desire to make a meaningful impact, I am excited to continue my journey in the analytics domain and contribute to the success of organizations through innovative data-driven solutions.
